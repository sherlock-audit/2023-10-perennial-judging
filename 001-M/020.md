# Only one callback per oracle version can be registered in the KeeperOracle callbacks

## Summary
Currently only one callback per oracle version can be registered in the KeeperOracle callbacks. When additional request occurs, then contract doesn't register new callbacks and as result those markets and accounts are not settled by keepers.
## Vulnerability Detail
When market need new oracle version for the position, then it [requests it from oracle service](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/Market.sol#L369).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/keeper/KeeperOracle.sol#L75-L85
```solidity
    function request(IMarket market, address account) external onlyAuthorized {
        uint256 currentTimestamp = current();
        if (versions[_global.currentIndex] == currentTimestamp) return;


        versions[++_global.currentIndex] = currentTimestamp;
        emit OracleProviderVersionRequested(currentTimestamp);


        _globalCallbacks[currentTimestamp].add(address(market));
        _localCallbacks[currentTimestamp][market].add(account);
        emit CallbackRequested(SettlementCallback(market, account, currentTimestamp));
    }
```
This function will add market to `_globalCallbacks` and account to the `_localCallbacks`. However, because of `versions[_global.currentIndex] == currentTimestamp` check, function will register callback only for the first requestor. All other requests will do nothing, function will return, so market and accounts will not be registered as callbacks.

When price for oracle version is commited, then all markets that are registered as `_globalCallbacks` for that version [are settled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/keeper/KeeperOracle.sol#L123-L124). Also, keepers call `settle` function in order [to settle all registered `_localCallbacks`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/keeper/KeeperOracle.sol#L141-L146) for the oracle version.

But currently protocol will not work as expected and only 1 market and 1 account will be settled per new oracle version.
## Impact
Markets and accounts will not be settled by keepers as it was designed.

## Recommendation
Change `request` function to this:
```solidity
function request(IMarket market, address account) external onlyAuthorized {
        uint256 currentTimestamp = current();
        if (versions[_global.currentIndex] != currentTimestamp) {
            versions[++_global.currentIndex] = currentTimestamp;
            emit OracleProviderVersionRequested(currentTimestamp);
        }

        _globalCallbacks[currentTimestamp].add(address(market));
        _localCallbacks[currentTimestamp][market].add(account);
        emit CallbackRequested(SettlementCallback(market, account, currentTimestamp));
    }
```
