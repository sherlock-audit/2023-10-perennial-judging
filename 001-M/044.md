# KeeperOracle callbacks only can set first market and user

## Summary
in `KeeperOracle.request(market,account)`
If the current timestamp has already requested `market`, the method will return directly. 
This leads to subsequent different `market`, `account` requests within the same timestamp not being recorded in `_globalCallbacks` and `_localCallbacks`. 
As a result, subsequent `commit()` and `settle()` have no way to callback these `market` and `account`. 
In reality, only one `market` and`user` can be called back at the same timestamp.

## Vulnerability Detail
in `KeeperOracle.request()`, This method will perform the following operations:
1. ++_global.currentIndex
2. versions[_global.currentIndex] = currentTimestamp
3. _globalCallbacks[currentTimestamp].add(address(market));
4. _localCallbacks[currentTimestamp][market].add(account);

The `_globalCallbacks` and `_localCallbacks` settings will trigger callbacks in `commit()` and `settle()`.

The code is as follows:
```solidity
    function request(IMarket market, address account) external onlyAuthorized {
        uint256 currentTimestamp = current();
@>      if (versions[_global.currentIndex] == currentTimestamp) return;

        versions[++_global.currentIndex] = currentTimestamp;
        emit OracleProviderVersionRequested(currentTimestamp);

        _globalCallbacks[currentTimestamp].add(address(market));
        _localCallbacks[currentTimestamp][market].add(account);
        emit CallbackRequested(SettlementCallback(market, account, currentTimestamp));
    }
```

From the above code, we can see that if the current timestamp has already been requested, it will return directly, and the subsequent `_globalCallbacks` and `_localCallbacks` settings will not be executed.

However, the problem is that `KeeperOracle` does not only serve one market and one user. If different markets or the same market and different users execute `request()` in the same timestamp, `_globalCallbacks` and `_localCallbacks` should be recorded for subsequent callbacks.

## Impact

At the same timestamp, for the markets and users that execute `request()`, except for first one that will be called back, the others will not be called back.
