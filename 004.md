# transfer of Ether without sufficient safety checks in the invoke function


## Summary
There is a potential vulnerability related to the transfer of Ether without sufficient safety checks in the `invoke` function. This vulnerability can lead to Ether being trapped in the contract or misused.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `invoke` function, there is a line of code that transfers Ether to `msg.sender` using the `transfer` function. However, this transfer is executed without sufficient safety checks. It is essential to ensure that Ether transfers are conducted securely, considering possible failure scenarios and reentrancy attacks.

## Impact
The lack of safety checks when transferring Ether can have the following impacts:
- Loss of Ether: If the transfer fails or is maliciously exploited, Ether can be lost or trapped in the contract.
- Vulnerability to Reentrancy Attacks: The lack of proper checks and state updates during Ether transfers can expose the contract to reentrancy attacks.

## Code Snippet
Here's the relevant code snippet from the `invoke` function that transfers Ether to `msg.sender`:

```solidity
// Eth must not remain in this contract at rest
payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L166

This code transfers the Ether balance of the contract to `msg.sender`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement safety checks and use best practices for handling Ether transfers. Specifically:
- Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- Ensure that the `transfer` operation is executed after all state updates to avoid reentrancy vulnerabilities.
- Consider using the more robust `send` or `revert` pattern for Ether transfers, which provides better control and error handling.
- Carefully monitor the gas usage during transfers to prevent out-of-gas issues.
