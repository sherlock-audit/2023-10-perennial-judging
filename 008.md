# Return values of transfer() not checked

## Summary
The call to transfer is done without checking the results.

It is usually good to add a require-statement that checks the return value or to use something like safeTransfer

## Vulnerability Detail
Not all IERC20 implementations revert() when there's a failure in transfer(). The function signature has a boolean return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually making a payment

## Impact
Not every ERC20 token reverts if a function call fails. It might also just return false. If it returns false, value is not checked and execution continues.
If this isn't checked, the system will enter a wrong state with an accounted, but not executed transfer.

        return super.transfer(to, amount);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a require statement to check return value.

We recommend using OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer function that handle the return value check.
