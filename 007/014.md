# Use Of `transfer` or `send` Instead Of `call` To Send Native Assets



### [L-04] Use Of `transfer` or `send` Instead Of `call` To Send Native Assets
### Severity
* Impact: Low
* Likelihood: Medium
### Description

The use of `transfer()` in the contracts may have unintended outcomes on the native asset being sent to the receiver. The transaction will fail when:

- The receiver address is a smart contract that does not implement a payable function.
- The receiver address is a smart contract that implements a payable fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units.
- The receiver address is a smart contract that implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through proxy, raising the call's gas usage above 2300.
- Additionally, using a gas value higher than 2300 might be mandatory for some multi-signature wallets.
