# There is no check on whether seqencers are down for Chainlink L2  Arbitrum, Optimism and Base

## Summary
The Kept.sol#_etherPrice() gets the Price of ETH but does not check if the sequencer is down or active as recommended by [Chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#overview)

## Vulnerability Detail
The is no check to know if sequencer is down for Arbitrum, Base and Optimism in Kept.sol#_etherPrice()
see: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#overview

```solidity
/// @notice Returns the price of ETH in terms of the keeper token
    /// @return The price of ETH in terms of the keeper token
    function _etherPrice() private view returns (UFixed18) {//@audit no sequencer check.
        (, int256 answer, , ,) = ethTokenOracleFeed().latestRoundData();//@audit-issue no staleness check
        return UFixed18Lib.from(Fixed18Lib.ratio(answer, 1e8)); // chainlink eth-usd feed uses 8 decimals
    }
```
From Chainlink Docs:
"If a sequencer becomes unavailable, it is impossible to access read/write APIs that consumers are using and applications on the L2 network will be down for most users."

## Impact
Malicious actors could leverage sequencer downtimes to profit and cause loss of funds.

## Recommendation
Implement the check for sequencer activeness like this: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#overview
