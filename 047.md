# Malicious users might grief other users by forcing execute orders

## Summary
Malicious users might grief other users by forcing execute orders.
## Vulnerability Detail
The fact that users can freely trigger order execution for others might introduce an opportunity for malicious users to grief others.
Consider this scenario:
- User A places an order but does not want to execute it yet; he is waiting for better timing.
- User B sees that and force execute the order (also get rewarded from it).
- User A eats loss if there is any from that order.
## Impact
Unfair for users who place their orders without immediate executing.

## Recommendation
