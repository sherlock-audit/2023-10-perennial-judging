# the `_unwrap` function in `MultiInvoker.sol`, can cause reverts when attempting to transfer DSU tokens from an external contract (ex., batcher) that does not have sufficient DSU tokens

## Summary
Highlights a vulnerability found in the MultiInvoker smart contract. The issue is related to the _unwrap function in MultiInvoker.sol, which can cause reverts when attempting to transfer DSU tokens from an external contract (e.g., batcher) that does not have sufficient DSU tokens. This could disrupt the normal operation of the contract, leading to a negative effect.


## Vulnerability Detail
Disruption of the normal operation of the contract.
Negative experience, especially when users rely on functions like _liquidate or _withdraw with wrap set to true.

## Impact
The vulnerability arises in the _unwrap function of the MultiInvoker smart contract. When attempting to transfer DSU tokens from an external contract (such as batcher), the code does not properly handle cases where the batcher contract does not have enough DSU tokens to fulfill the unwrap operation. In such cases, the current code directly reverts, making it impossible for users to execute _liquidate or _withdraw with wrap set to true when the batcher contract has an insufficient balance of DSU tokens.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
/// @notice Helper function to unwrap `amount` DSU into USDC and send to `receiver`
/// @param receiver Address to receive the USDC
/// @param amount Amount of DSU to unwrap
function _unwrap(address receiver, UFixed18 amount) internal {
    // Check the balance of DSU in the batcher
    UFixed18 batcherBalance = UFixed18Lib.from(DSU.balanceOf(address(batcher)));
    
    if (address(batcher) == address(0) || amount.gt(batcherBalance)) {
        // Use the reserve if the batcher doesn't have enough DSU tokens
        reserve.redeem(amount);
        if (receiver != address(this)) USDC.push(receiver, UFixed6Lib.from(amount));
    } else {
        // Unwrap the DSU into USDC and return to the receiver
        batcher.unwrap(amount, receiver);
    }
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a proper error-handling mechanism to gracefully handle the situation where the batcher has insufficient DSU tokens to perform the unwrap. This may involve checking the balance of DSU in the batcher contract and deciding how to proceed based on the available balance. For example, you could use conditional logic to either use the reserve or initiate a different action. The exact solution will depend on your contract's design and requirements.
```solidity
/// @notice Helper function to unwrap `amount` DSU into USDC and send to `receiver`
/// @param receiver Address to receive the USDC
/// @param amount Amount of DSU to unwrap
function _unwrap(address receiver, UFixed18 amount) internal {
    // Check the balance of DSU in the batcher
    UFixed18 batcherBalance = UFixed18Lib.from(DSU.balanceOf(address(batcher)));
    
    if (address(batcher) == address(0) || amount.gt(batcherBalance)) {
        // Use the reserve if the batcher doesn't have enough DSU tokens
        reserve.redeem(amount);
        if (receiver != address(this)) USDC.push(receiver, UFixed6Lib.from(amount));
    } else {
        // Unwrap the DSU into USDC and return to the receiver
        batcher.unwrap(amount, receiver);
    }
}
```
