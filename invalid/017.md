# Missing checks for `address(0)` in functions

## Summary
Smart contracts in the given repository lack the necessary checks for the zero address during initialization. This oversight can lead to critical issues where tokens or rights may be unintentionally assigned to an address that can never be used, leading to permanent loss of assets or access rights.


## Vulnerability Detail
The constructors and initializers of the contracts do not validate against the zero address. This can result in the permanent loss of tokens if they are sent to the zero address by mistake, as these tokens cannot be retrieved. Furthermore, setting critical addresses, such as marketFactory, vaultFactory, batcher, and reserve to the zero address could cripple the contract functionality.


## Impact
The impact of not checking for the zero address is medium as it could lead to asset loss or a halt in contract functionality. However, the likelihood is considered low, assuming careful deployment practices. Nonetheless, the risk should not be overlooked.

## Tool used
Manual Review - Used my own static analyzer (still in development)

## Recommendation
It is strongly recommended to implement checks to prevent the zero address from being set during the initialization of contracts. This can be achieved by adding require statements that ensure address parameters are not the zero address.
