# invoke() contracts that do not accept eth cannot execute

## Summary

in `MultiInvoker.invoke()` performs `transfer()` to return the remaining `eth` in the contract, regardless of whether the caller passes `value` or not.
This will result in contract users who cannot accept `eth` being unable to execute `invoke()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
in MultiInvoker.invoke()
If user pays `value` and any eth left after invocations are executed, we should return the eth to the user to avoid eth remaining in the contract.
The code is as follows

```solidity
    function invoke(Invocation[] calldata invocations) external payable {
        for(uint i = 0; i < invocations.length; ++i) {
            Invocation memory invocation = invocations[i];
.......
            } else if (invocation.action == PerennialAction.COMMIT_PRICE) {
                (address oracleProviderFactory, uint256 value, bytes32[] memory ids, uint256 version, bytes memory data, bool revertOnFailure) =
                    abi.decode(invocation.args, (address, uint256, bytes32[], uint256, bytes, bool));

                _commitPrice(oracleProviderFactory, value, ids, version, data, revertOnFailure);
            } else if (invocation.action == PerennialAction.LIQUIDATE) {
                (IMarket market, address account, bool revertOnFailure) = abi.decode(invocation.args, (IMarket, address, bool));

                _liquidate(market, account, revertOnFailure);
            } else if (invocation.action == PerennialAction.APPROVE) {
                (address target) = abi.decode(invocation.args, (address));

                _approve(target);
            }

            // Eth must not remain in this contract at rest
@>          payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```
As we can see from the code above, The `transfer()` will be executed regardless of whether the user passes in a `value` or not.
This will result  the contract users cannot accept `eth` always `revert `

For example, if I am a third party and I write a contract to execute another user's order or to perform liquidate logic, I get what should be `DSU`
I don't need to accept `eth`, so I don't implement `receive()`, this contract doesn't accept `eth`.

But since `invoke()` always calls `transfer()`, it will cause this type of contract to revert when calling `transfer()`

## Impact

contract users who cannot accept `eth` to be unable to execute `invoke()`.
