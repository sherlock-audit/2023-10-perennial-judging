# Use Of `transfer` or `send` Instead Of `call` To Send Native Assets

## Summary
The use of .transfer() or .send() for transferring native assets in smart contracts is discouraged due to the 2300 gas stipend limit, which may not be sufficient for all transactions, particularly when interacting with contracts requiring more complex computations in their fallback functions.


## Vulnerability Detail
Using .transfer() or .send() for sending Ether can cause transactions to fail if the receiver is a contract that requires more than the gas stipend of 2300 gas units. This limitation makes these methods less flexible and potentially risky when sending Ether to unknown contracts, as it assumes all contracts can operate within this gas limit.


## Impact
The impact of this issue is low, given that the failure of Ether transfer does not typically compromise the contract's security. However, it can lead to a poor user experience and could potentially disrupt the contract's intended flow.

## Tool used

Manual Review - Used my own static analyzer (still in development)

## Recommendation
It is recommended to replace .transfer() or .send() with .call() in combination with .value() to send native assets. This method allows specifying the exact amount of gas to send along with the transaction, providing greater flexibility and reducing the risk of failed transactions due to out-of-gas errors.
