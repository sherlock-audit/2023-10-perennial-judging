# Use the ERC20Upgradable instead of ERC20 contract for upgradable Reward.sol

## Summary
The Reward.sol contract is upgradable but uses the ERC20 contract. Use the ERC20Upgradeable because the ERC20 contract initializes its state variables in the constructor which will not apply to the proxy contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Reward.sol is an upgradable contract but does not the Upgradeable contract of the ERC20. It instead used the non upgradeable ERC20 which will cause some issues. 

- Use the ERC20Upgradeable contract not the ERC20 contract.

```solidity
 /// @notice Constructs the contract
    /// @param underlying_ The underlying token that is distributed as a reward
    /// @param exchangeRate_ The exchange rate between the underlying token and the reward token
    constructor(Token18 underlying_, UFixed18 exchangeRate_) ERC20("Reward", "") {//@audit why not use the upgradable erc20
        underlying = underlying_;
        exchangeRate = exchangeRate_;
    }
```
## Impact
Partial state update in the proxy contract.
