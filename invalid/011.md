# Missing checks for `address(0)` in constructor/initializers


### [L-01] Missing checks for `address(0)` in constructor/initializers
### Severity
* Impact: Medium
* Likelihood: Low
### Description

In Solidity, the Ethereum address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` is known as the "zero address". This address has significance because it's the default value for uninitialized address variables and is often used to represent an invalid or non-existent address. The "Missing zero address control" issue arises when a Solidity smart contract does not properly check or prevent interactions with the zero address, leading to unintended behavior.
For instance, a contract might allow tokens to be sent to the zero address without any checks, which essentially burns those tokens as they become irretrievable. While sometimes this is intentional, without proper control or checks, accidental transfers could occur.
